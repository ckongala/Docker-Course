The main focus is on **Docker**, **containers**, and **virtual machines (VMs)**, and how they work together. We'll also cover some advanced topics related to Docker and Kubernetes. 

### Key Topics to Be Covered:

1. **Containers vs Virtual Machines (VMs)**:  
   - **Containers** are lightweight and run applications in isolated environments. They share the same OS kernel, which makes them faster and more efficient than VMs.
   - **VMs** are like fully separate computers with their own operating systems. They use more resources compared to containers.

2. **Docker**:  
   Docker is a tool used to create, deploy, and manage containers. We will explore the basic and advanced Docker commands, including how to manage networking and storage for containers.

3. **Networking in Docker**:  
   Docker containers can communicate with each other using different network types, such as:
   - **Bridge Network** (default setup).
   - **Host Network** (shares the host’s network).
   - **None Network** (isolates the container from all networks).

4. **Docker Volumes**:  
   When using Docker, the system will store data in a specific location. This can grow over time and use up a lot of space. So, we will learn how to manage storage by using **volumes** (special storage areas) and how to change the default location for these files.

5. **Dockerfile**:  
   A **Dockerfile** is a set of instructions to build a Docker image. We’ll learn about different commands inside a Dockerfile (e.g., `COPY`, `ADD`, `ENTRYPOINT`) and how they work.

6. **Deleting Unused Docker Images**:  
   Sometimes, Docker images become "dangling," meaning they’re no longer in use. These images take up space, so we’ll learn how to delete them using **Docker system prune**.

7. **Google Distroless Images**:  
   These are lightweight Docker images that don’t have a shell or extra tools. They are ideal for running containers with minimal overhead, but they’re hard to modify.

8. **Multi-stage Builds**:  
   This is a way to create smaller and more efficient Docker images. Multi-stage builds let you keep the image size small by only including necessary parts, making it faster to deploy and safer.

9. **Pushing Docker Images to a Repository**:  
   You can upload Docker images to a **Docker Hub** (public) or **ECR** (private) so others can use them. We'll also learn how to tag images and push them to these repositories.

10. **Docker Compose**:  
   **Docker Compose** helps you define and run multi-container Docker applications. It makes it easier to manage complex applications with multiple containers.

11. **Docker Swarm vs Kubernetes**:  
   - **Docker Swarm** is another tool for managing containers, but it has limitations.
   - **Kubernetes** is more powerful and widely used for orchestrating containers at scale. The instructor will explain the differences and why Kubernetes is preferred in many cases.


### Learning Path
- Before diving into Docker, it’s recommended to learn **AWS** (Amazon Web Services) basics, as it helps with understanding cloud environments where Docker and Kubernetes are often used.
- The instructor emphasizes that these sessions will be hands-on and practical, not just theory. So, the goal is for you to actually learn how to use Docker and Kubernetes in real projects.
